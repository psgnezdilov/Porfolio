                <p>My name is Pavel and I am currently a Computer Science at DCU in Ireland. I was born in Russia but moved to Spain at the age of 14 without any knowledge of their language. I went there to the secondary and high schools.
                I learned Spanish and Catalan there by just listening to my peers and understanding the meaning of words from context.</p>
                <p>I have very broad interests in pretty much everything. I have tried multiple sports and instruments, and because I lived in Spain now I know 4 different languages and willing to learn more.</p>

                        During my internship at Google, I contributed to a collaborative project focused on optimizing backend systems for data processing.
                        My primary role was to design and implement modules that streamlined data workflows, reducing processing times by 20% on average.
                        I worked closely with a team of engineers, enhancing my skills in Python, SQL, and distributed computing.
                        Additionally, I gained experience with Googleâ€™s internal tools and cloud services, which broadened my understanding of scalable architecture.

                    <p>
                        Throughout the internship, I regularly presented progress updates, participated in code reviews, and received mentorship from senior engineers.
                        This experience improved my technical skills and problem-solving abilities and gave me insight into agile project management.
                        By the end of my internship, I had contributed to a codebase used in production,
                        gaining hands-on experience in software engineering within a world-class environment that emphasized innovation and team collaboration.

                        As a Full-Stack Development Intern at Meta, I worked on a dynamic web application to enhance user experience and increase engagement across platforms.
                        My main contributions included developing and refining both frontend components in React and backend APIs in Node.js.
                        I collaborated closely with UX designers to implement responsive, user-friendly interfaces and optimized data retrieval processes, which improved load times by 15%.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, I integrated features with internal APIs and contributed to the unit and integration testing process, ensuring reliability and smooth deployment.
                        Through regular code reviews and mentorship sessions with experienced engineers, I developed best practices in code efficiency and modular design.
                        My work was part of a larger team project that followed agile methodologies, enhancing my collaboration and project management skills.
                        This internship reinforced my expertise in full-stack development, particularly in crafting scalable, user-focused solutions in a high-impact tech environment.

                        As a Machine Learning Intern at OpenAI, I focused on developing and fine-tuning models for natural language processing (NLP) applications.
                        My primary responsibilities included data preprocessing, implementing algorithms, and optimizing model performance for real-world applications.
                        I worked extensively with Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to build and evaluate models, achieving a 12% increase in accuracy on key benchmarks.

                    <p>
                        Working alongside research scientists and engineers, I contributed to a project that explored the use of transformer models to improve conversational AI.
                        I participated in weekly research discussions, gaining insights into the latest advancements in machine learning and deep learning techniques.
                        Regular code reviews and mentorship enhanced my understanding of model interpretability, data efficiency, and best practices for AI deployment.
                        This internship not only solidified my technical foundation in machine learning but also offered me hands-on experience with cutting-edge research in an innovative, collaborative environment.
